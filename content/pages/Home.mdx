    description: >-
      In 2024, the Performant team had an "All Hands" meeting in Boston, and we
      collected data and created a few themed projects using tools that we
      developed. We created data models in Core Data and then launched a site
      that pulls data from three different projects:

      -- Dead Media Tour

      -- Made Land, Statues and Old Buildings

      -- Obstructionism on the Freedom Trail
